Foody Mart

# Project Description

Foody Mart is an online supermarket in the making, it has a total of five different sections as of now which are:
1. Home
2. Shop
3. Checkout
4. About
5. Contacts 

All sections are on the same page. While the user is scrolling the text in the navigation bar will highlight to the section the user is currently at accordingly, the user can also click on any of the navigation links to direct them to that section quickly.

The navigation bar has been created using javascript by adding the elements to an empty ul list.

The page will reposition according to the size of the device the user is using.

The checkout form won't be able to do much for now since the shop is still in the works.

The user can click on any of the social media contacts list to direct them to that page.
